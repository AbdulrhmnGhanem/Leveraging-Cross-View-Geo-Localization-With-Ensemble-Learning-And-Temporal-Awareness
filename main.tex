\section*{Abstract}
In some situations the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is unreliable. To mend the poor GNSS signal, an autonomous vehicle can self-localize by matching a ground image against a database of geotagged aerial images. It is easy to construct an aerial dataset, so this approach is preferable to other image-based localization techniques. But, this approach is challenging: there are dramatic viewpoint changes between aerial and ground views, harsh weather and lighting conditions, and lack of orientation information, in training and deployment environments. In this paper, we show that previous models in this area are complementary, not competitive, and that each model solves a different aspect of the problem. We propose an ensemble model to aggregate the predictions of multiple independently trained state-of-the-art models. Also, we show the effect of making the query process temporal-aware  But none of the existing benchmark datasets is suitable for extensive temporal awareness experiments, we generated a new derivative dataset based on the BDD100K dataset. This paper also proposes an efficient temporal awareness mechanism: Naive History, to prove that fusing the temporal information of the trip with the model prediction significantly improves the accuracy. Our ensemble model achieves a recall accuracy R@1 of 97.74\% on the CVUSA dataset and 91.43\% on the CVACT dataset (surpassing the current state-of-the-art). Our temporal awareness mechanism converges to R@1 of ~100\% by looking at a few steps back in the trip history. We expect this study to initialize the building of deployable ensemble cross-view geo-localization models that take advantage of temporal proximity between ground images.

\section*{Introduction}
The current standard localization technique is the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Although the GNSS accuracy declines in cases where there are few lines of sight (e.g., urban canyons~\cite{bib1}). Using cross-view geo-localization, a vehicle localizes itself by matching street view images against a database of geotagged images captured from aerial platforms (e.g., a satellite~\cite{bib2} or a drone~\cite{bib3}). Cross-view geo-localization is gaining popularity in the scene of autonomous vehicles~\cite{bib2} and robotic navigation~\cite{bib25}: it compensates for a bad GNSS signal-to-noise ratio. And,  it’s preferable to other image-based localization techniques (e.g., landmark and ground-to-ground matching) for the ease of covering new areas. Early work~\cite{bib37} on this technique claimed that its main challenge is the lack of visual correspondence between aerial and ground views. Later work, while holding the same claim, showed that there are more challenges: geographic scene changes over time~\cite{bib6,bib7,bib8,bib9,bib10}, poor weather and lighting conditions, lack of orientation information~\cite{bib4}, and misalignment between aerial and ground images during training.
None of the previous models tried to collectively address these five challenges. To build a holistic solution for the problem, we propose an ensemble model to fuse the predictions of five independently trained models. Each of these models addresses a different challenge..
Moreover, most of the recent work treats the problem as a 1-to-1 image-matching task. This overlooks the fact that these models get deployed in environments where there's a continuous stream of input, not a single query image. Taking the temporal nature of the problem into account is a must:  our experiments showed that the recent models can't differentiate between highly similar query images, and in the case of a moving vehicle, the consecutive images have a high degree of similarity. Some recent models considered the temporal nature of the problem.~\cite{bib7}  and~\cite{bib20,bib21,bib22} used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to predict the current pose and enforce temporal consistency.~\cite{bib24} enforces temporal consistency by using a transformer-based trajectory smoothing network. We can see that these methods are resource intensive or have strong assumptions about the current state of the vehicle. We explore an efficient technique to achieve the same goal.
Although the existing datasets aren't suitable for conducting experiments to prove that temporal awareness improves accuracy. The dataset needs to be realistic and collected as a trajectory of close points over a long-running journey to resemble driving in a real environment.  CVUSA~\cite{bib55} and CVACT~\cite{bib4} include sparse points on the map. VIGOR~\cite{bib5} includes dense points but doesn't form trajectories. RobotCar~\cite{bib6} has a limited number of examples. So we had to introduce a new derivative dataset based on the BDD100K~\cite{bib12} dataset to fill this gap.

\subsection*{In summary, the contributions of this paper are:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce a new ensemble model based on five of the current state-of-the-art  cross-view matching networks. The ensemble model achieves a recall accuracy R@1 of 97.74\% on the CVUSA dataset and 91.43\% on the CVACT dataset.
    \item We construct a new derivative dataset that is suitable for temporal aware cross-view geo-localization models based on BDD100K.
    \item We develope a meta block: Naive History, to make the query process temporal aware. We show that taking journey history into account minimizes the search space. This reduction in search space improves the accuracy.  The accuracy converges to ~100\% with a three-step lookback into trip history on our proposed dataset. This meta block is usable with any CV model.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the related work. Section III discusses the details of the methodology and the experimental work. We conclude the paper in Section IV.

\section*{Related work}
In section (A), we start by investigating how different models engineered their features and architectures. Their choices show us how different models tried to approach the problem from different angles. Followed by giving a bird-eye-view of the architectures of these models and feature extraction methods. In section (B), we walk through the models that tried blending the trip history into the image-matching task. By grouping the models into two categories: one that relies on "this place looks familiar" in section (B.1), and one that relies on "where have we been before getting here?" in section (B.2).
\subsection*{A) Features and architectures}
Most of the recent work treated the cross-view geo-localization task as an image retrieval task. They tried to find a feature representation suitable for matching query ground images and aerial ground images. The nature and complexity of used networks changed over time. Here, we conduct a brief comparison between the most common feature representations and their architectures. Table~\ref{table1} summarizes the feature types and the backbones of different cross-view geo-localization networks.
